# Church Single Page Web Application Demo Template

This web application is a demo illustration of a mock-up design I created for the **Renaissance Assembly INC**. The primary goal was to showcase my skills to secure a remote job at the organization.

The single-page design includes ***CTRs (Click-Through-Rates)*** that could serve as the foundation for a complete, full-scale church management system software.

**Disclaimer:** This design is for portfolio purposes only and does not represent the organization's currently used software. The objective is to demonstrate my capabilities as a **Full Stack Web Developer and API Developer** with proven skill in building systems from scratch and cloning existing systems.
