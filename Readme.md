# Church Single Page Web Application Demo Template

This web application is a demo illustration of a mock-up design I created for the **Renaissance Assembly INC**. The primary goal was to showcase my skills to secure a remote job at the organization.

The single-page design includes ***CTRs (Click-Through-Rates)*** that could serve as the foundation for a complete, full-scale church management system software.

**Disclaimer:** This design is for portfolio purposes only and does not represent the organization's currently used software. The objective is to demonstrate my capabilities as a **Full Stack Web Developer and API Developer** with proven skill in building systems from scratch and cloning existing systems.

## Branch Improvement Summary

In this design branch, I refactored the project structure by converting the main HTML layout into a modular PHP architecture. Each major section of the page has been broken into reusable components to improve maintainability, speed up debugging, and make feature expansion easier.   

I also introduced a centralized App Configuration file where key application information is defined as constants. These constants are now used across the frontend, ensuring cleaner code, better consistency, and easier updates.

##  Lessons Learned

This project improved my ability to:
- Deconstruct complex UI layouts and rebuild them efficiently  
- Structure my Single Page Application (SPA) using component-based code structure (HTML and CSS) for better maintainability.
- Focus on creating punchy and engaging content buildup through careful section-by-section design.
